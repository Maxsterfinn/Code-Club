            <h1> Variables </h1>
            <p> Variables in JavaScript are written in the following form. </p>
            <p id="quote"><span id="ex1">var</span> <span id="ex2">[name]</span> = <span id="ex2">[value]</span> </p>
            <p> "name" can be anything you want to name it. </p>
            <p> "value" can be something like a number, a function, a string/text, or true/false. </p>
            <p> Variables are used to store values that can be used for later. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="func">
            <h1> Functions </h1>
            <p> Functions are written like this. </p>
            <p id="quote"> 
                <span id="ex3">function</span> <span id="ex2">[name]</span>() {<br>
                <span id="ex4"><span id="ex2">[logic]</span></span><br>
                }
            </p>
            <p> "name" can be anything you want to name it. </p>
            <p> "logic" is where the logic of your function goes. </p>
            <p> Functions are used for making a part of your website do something, particularly buttons. </p>

            <h1> Applying to HTML</h1>
            <p> Getting our JavaScript to our HTML requires some HTML code. </p>
            <p id="quote"> &lt;<span id="ex3">script</span> <span id="ex1">src</span>="<span id="ex2">[file location]</span>"&gt;&lt;/<span id="ex3">script</span>&gt; </p>
            <p> "file location" is the location of your JavaScript file. If it is in the same folder as your HTML file then just write the name of your file. If it is
                in another folder then add "../[folder name]/[file name]". </p>
            <p> We add this line inbetween our &lt;head&gt; tags to get our JavaScript file to be read. </p>
            <p id="quote"> &lt;<span id="ex3">button</span> <span id="ex1">onclick</span>="<span id="ex2">[function name]()</span>"&gt; [button name] &lt;/<span id="ex3">button</span>&gt;</p>
            <p> "function name" is the name of the funciton you want to use in your JavaScript file. </p>
            <p> "button name" is the text that will be shown inside your button. </p>
            <p> This is the code we would need for our button that runs our JavaScript code. </p>
